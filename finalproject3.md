# The Final Data Story
[Internet Access in West Virginia](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/internet-access-in-west-virginia/index.html)

# Changes Made since Part II

I was in a pretty strong place when I submitted part 2 of my final project. Therefore I had very few changes to make before submitting my final project. From my user research, the main changes I identified from these conversations were to rename my first visualization; add some more context to the background section about West Virginia's connectivity and Wetzel County specifically; and cater the call to action to all audiences. 

### Visualization Names

I renamed my first visualization and I think that it really helped to emphasize the main points. I changed the title to "Counties with more than 1 in 5 households offline." This is both shorter than my original title and is a more impactful statement than my original name. I kept the other 3 visualizations as they were because the context panes next to them provide details describing the visual. 

### Background Context

I added some more context to the background of West Virginia's lack of internet access. In my final shorthand, I added content on how it is most often communities of the lowest education attainment, the lowest median income, and the highest ages that are offline in West Virginia. I also wanted to emphasize to people more unfamiliar with the area just how close Wetzel County is to Pittsburgh. I considered adding a map of the route into my shorthand, but I believe it distracted from the presentation's message. Therefore I decided to just add more context into the text section instead.

### Call to Action

I additionally revisited my call to action. My story has multiple audiences, so I edited the call to action to have specific calls to action for each audience group: policy makers, advocates, and West Virginia residents. 

# Audience

I believe my story has 3 audiences: policymakers, advocates, and West Virginia residents. I included policymakers because they have the strongest ability to create change in this field. Advocates are included in the discussion as well because this is the category that most viewers of my presentation fall into. West Virginia residents should also be included in the presentation as this actively affects their day to day. Since I have these 3 audiences, I also have 3 calls to action. Policymakers initiative is to pass legislation prioritizing broadband expansion. Advocates calls to action are to use their voice for those who need a platform to stand on. West Virginia residents have less of a call to action, but moreso I was hoping to provide them with resources to better their experiences with broadband.

# Final design decisions

I had some conflicting thoughts on utilizing the neon green in my message, but I decided to stick with it. While green is often correlated with good, I think the shade of green here has more of a technology feel than the standard shades of green. 

# References

All references are listed in the reference section of the shorthand linked in the first section of this webpage.

# Final thoughts

One thing I wish I could have figured out, but didn't have time to revisit, was to embed the first visualization instead of inserting it as an image. Every time I did try embedding it, the visualizations background became transparent and therefore was difficult to follow in shorthand. 
Overall, I believe that I did a really great job presenting this data. I am very passionate about bringing West Virginia into policy conversations. West Virginia is so often left behind, and I want to use my platform for them. I'm proud of the way this project developed.
