# The final data story
[Internet Access in West Virginia](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/internet-access-in-west-virginia/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
I was in a pretty strong place when I submitted part 2 of my final project. Therefore I had very few changes to make before submitting my final project. From my user research, the main changes I identified from these conversations were to rename my first visualization; add some more context to the background section about West Virginia's connectivity and Wetzel County specifically; and cater the call to action to all audiences. 
## Visualization Names
I renamed my first visualization and I think that it really helped to emphasize the main points. I changed the title to "Counties with more than 1 in 5 households offline." This is both shorter than my original title and is a more impactful statement than my original name. I kept the other 3 visualizations as they were because the context panes next to them provide details describing the visual. 
## Background Context
I added some more context to the background of West Virginia's lack of internet access. In my final shorthand, I added content on how it is most often communities of the lowest education attainment, the lowest median income, and the highest ages that are offline in West Virginia. WETZEL COUNTY
## Call to Action
I additionally revisited my call to action. My story has multiple audiences, so I edited the call to action to have specific calls to action for each audience group: policy makers, advocates, and West Virginia residents.
