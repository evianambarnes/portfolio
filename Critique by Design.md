I selected this visualization because I am a huge fan of the US Women's National Team. I recently watched their Under Pressure docuseries on Netflix and cried most of the way through it. I grew up playing soccer and have always admired these women. It is important to me that they receive the compensation they deserve. The visualization in this article is impactful, but I felt I could create a visualization that is quicker to read and entices the reader to learn more. 

# The Redesign Process
## The First Draft
I began with some sketches of potential visualizations that would emphasize the size of the pay gap. At first, I considered pursuing a line chart to show how the pay changes throughout each world cup phase. After a couple drawings and exploring tableau, I realized this might not be the most effective way to convey this information because of the way the pay gap moves with lump sums throughout each phase. If this was a continuous data set and the space between each phase held mroe meaning, then a line chart would have been more useful. But, that doesn't apply to this data set. After hitting a wall with that idea, I decided to do some research on pay gap visualizations. I then found a stacked bar chart that I felt was more impactful. I took to tableau and began testing out some visualizations. It took awhile for me to figure out how to create this visualization in tableau the way I had imagined it in my head. After some work, I felt I was at a point where feedback would be helpful.
## Feedback 1
 I knew I wasn't done, but it felt like a good time to check in. I showed the participant the visualization below: ![image](https://github.com/evianambarnes/portfolio/assets/156966766/80f02074-60af-489c-be3f-5e26d79068c8)
 My participant (student, late 20s) was not very familiar with soccer. But, they quickly identified this was a comparison of pay. The most constructive feedback from this student came when they asked, "What does the sum of these values mean?" Unfortunately, my answer was, "nothing." I hadn't realized that my stacked bars were summing. I was attempting to create the visualization in a way that layered the bars on one another, not summed them. The sum of each gender's average earnings at each phase is a useless value. After this conversation, I felt like I had taken three steps forward and two steps back. I knew I was on the right track, but had some more refining to do. 
## Feedback 2
After spending some time working on getting the height of the bar at the male players' pay, not the sum of the values, I realized this still might not be the best way to show the pay gap. After all, my main goal in redesign was to emphasize the **gap**. So, I moved towards a bar chart that would display the pay levels in separate bars, but right next to each other in each world cup phase. When I felt ready, I sought out feedback on this visualization: ![image](https://github.com/evianambarnes/portfolio/assets/156966766/6cf7deff-22d4-4b38-aed2-1784b227a8c8)
This participant (adult, early 50s) was able to very quickly recognize exactly what I was showing. They said, "The eye is drawn to the blue, emphasizing how low women's pay is." This feedback was helpful, and I was glad I chose grey for men's pay, but I still felt I could elicit a more emotional response.
## Final Touches
After trying out different colors and titles, I found myself with a visualization that just felt right. 
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707233798295' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='US Gender Pay Gap Grows Throughout World Cup Advancement ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;US&#47;USGenderPayGapintheWorldCup&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='USGenderPayGapintheWorldCup&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;US&#47;USGenderPayGapintheWorldCup&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1707233798295');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);               
</script>
I changed the women's pay to red, a color both signifiying alarm and is heavily present on both teams' uniforms. The title helps the reader use their eye travel to watch how the gap grows as you read the visualization from left to right, and makes it clear that we are looking at US data. I feel comfortable with my visualization now, I'm proud of it. This process was frustrating, humbling, and rewarding. 

## Concluding Thoughts
I believe my final visualization choice is stronger at emphasizing the gap than the original visualization. I did like the original, but it wasn't a visualization that was easy to quickly view. I think it was important to make this a visualization that was visible in one pane because it is not common knowledge that the US Women's National Team is underpaid. By remaking this visualization with less eye travel, I think I created something that raises awareness for the gender pay gap in US soccer. 

## Next Time
As I continue learning through this course, I want to explore dashboards. I think it could have been even more impactful to add in information through text about how the US women's team has won the world cup 4 times, and the men have never won. Additionally, it could have been strong to quantify the marginal increases throughout each phase ina n additional visualization. I played around with the dashboard for awhile, but I couldn't create something that felt as strong as the visualization I had already created. But, I'm sure by the end of this course, I will be able to knit all of these together!
