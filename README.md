# About Me
My name is Eviana Barnes, and I use she/her pronouns. I am a second year MSPPM flagship student. I'm originally from West Virginia and did my undergraduate at WVU studying economics and accounting. I will be working as a policy analyst after graduation. Outside of school, I love to travel and teach yoga.
# What I hope to learn...
My job after graduation requires creating reports that convey the effectiveness of policy. Data visualizations help make these reports more impactful and useful to policymakers.
