# Final Project Part 2
# Storyboard

During this phase of the final project, I really wanted to focus on making my story arc more impactful. To kick off the set up, I decided to relate to the audience through my introduction by reminding the viewers just how often we all use the internet. I researched some statistics here to drive the point home. The data is from credible and well-known sources like statista and Pew Research Center. Next, I moved towards the conflict: how low internet access is in West Virginia. Originally, I had pictured my story utilizing a choropleth map of the lower 48 showing broadband access, but once I played around with the data, I realized that this would be an overwhelming visual that doesn't do much to aid my narrative. Instead, to show how West Virginia compares to the nation, I decided to create a bar graph showing the percent of counties in West Virginia where more than 20% of households do not have internet compared to the nationwide statistic of percent of counties where more than 20% of households do not have internet. Below is the visualization I created in Data Wrapper.


<iframe title="% of Counties where more than 1/5 Households Lack Internet Access" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Opmwg" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Opmwg/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="526" height="393" data-external="1"></iframe>



I chose these colors because this green creates a feel of technology. I pulled the color directly from the visual I am using as my cover image for my shorthand. 
The main feedback I received from my user research was to add information on why West Virginia's broadband is so low. So, after presenting the data comparing West Virginia to national data, I added in some information about the two main reasons behind the lack of internet access in West Virginia: lack of service providers and terrain. Next, I wanted to keep zooming in and look at the data on a county level. Here is where I made a choropleth map of West Virginia showing the percent of households without internet access in each county. I stuck with the same color scheme of greens for this map. I made the map in ArcGIS and it is pictured below.

Then I manipulated the same map to emphasize the 22 counties where more than 20% of households do not have internet access. I did this by greying out all other counties and keeping the low internet access counties green. The second map can be seen here.

Next, I kept the map nearly the same, but I outlined Wetzel County. I chose to focus on Wetzel County because it is only a two-hour drive south of Pittsburgh and borders the West Virginia county with the most internet access, Monongalia County. Here is my next map:

I decided to keep zooming in to humanize the data set. I researched education, employment, and poverty statistics in Wetzel County. Then I compared these statistics to Allegheny County to help the audience conceptualize the statistics they were reading. The next section of my shorthand mirrors this section but shows how broadband access can improve each of these variables.

The last section of my presentation focuses on resolution, or a call to action. First the audience is presented with action items they can take to advocate for broadband expansion. Then I provided resources for West Virginia residents to test their wifi speed and find free wifi stations near them.

# User research 

## Target audience
I believe my target audience is multi-faceted. On the one hand, this could be shown to legislators, so they understand how detrimental it is for rural communities to not have internet access. Additionally, the target audience could be West Virginians living in counties with the highest percentages of internet access by household. These residents could be inspired by my presentation to make sure they elect politicians who prioritize broadband expansion. I think that residents of the counties with better internet access would be shocked to learn just how many of their neighboring counties do not have access. West Virginians are known for having a deep sense of loyalty and kindness towards one another, so I believe this presentation could evoke an emotional reaction from them. My presentation also speaks to people in metropolitan areas in neighboring states. By zooming in on Wetzel county, I am humanizing the data for Pittsburgh residents, since Wetzel County is only a two hour drive away.

## Interviewees
I decided to interview a West Virginia resident, a new Pittsburgh resident, and someone who has lived in Pittsburgh most of their life for my user research. I think these people were good choices because they represent different demographics from my target audience. I want to see if the presentation resonates with each of them. I am especially interested in hearing from the person who is new to Pittsburgh, to see if I can make them feel pulled to act on this cause since they do not have ties to the area.
