# Final Project Part 2
# Storyboard

During this phase of the final project, I really wanted to focus on making my story arc more impactful. To kick off the set up, I decided to relate to the audience through my introduction by reminding the viewers just how often we all use the internet. I researched some statistics here to drive the point home. The data is from credible and well-known sources like statista and Pew Research Center. Next, I moved towards the conflict: how low internet access is in West Virginia. Originally, I had pictured my story utilizing a choropleth map of the lower 48 showing broadband access, but once I played around with the data, I realized that this would be an overwhelming visual that doesn't do much to aid my narrative. Instead, to show how West Virginia compares to the nation, I decided to create a bar graph showing the percent of counties in West Virginia where more than 20% of households do not have internet compared to the nationwide statistic of percent of counties where more than 20% of households do not have internet. Below is the visualization I created in Data Wrapper.


<iframe title="% of Counties where more than 1/5 Households Lack Internet Access" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Opmwg" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Opmwg/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="526" height="393" data-external="1"></iframe>



I chose these colors because this green creates a feel of technology. I pulled the color directly from the visual I am using as my cover image for my shorthand. 
The main feedback I received from my user research was to add information on why West Virginia's broadband is so low. So, after presenting the data comparing West Virginia to national data, I added in some information about the two main reasons behind the lack of internet access in West Virginia: lack of service providers and terrain. Next, I wanted to keep zooming in and look at the data on a county level. Here is where I made a choropleth map of West Virginia showing the percent of households without internet access in each county. I stuck with the same color scheme of greens for this map. I made the map in ArcGIS and it is pictured below.

Then I manipulated the same map to emphasize the 22 counties where more than 20% of households do not have internet access. I did this by greying out all other counties and keeping the low internet access counties green. The second map can be seen here.

Next, I kept the map nearly the same, but I outlined Wetzel County. I chose to focus on Wetzel County because it is only a two-hour drive south of Pittsburgh and borders the West Virginia county with the most internet access, Monongalia County. Here is my next map:

I decided to keep zooming in to humanize the data set. I researched education, employment, and poverty statistics in Wetzel County. Then I compared these statistics to Allegheny County to help the audience conceptualize the statistics they were reading. The next section of my shorthand mirrors this section but shows how broadband access can improve each of these variables.

The last section of my presentation focuses on resolution, or a call to action. First the audience is presented with action items they can take to advocate for broadband expansion. Then I provided resources for West Virginia residents to test their wifi speed and find free wifi stations near them.

# User research 

## Target audience
I believe my target audience is multi-faceted. On the one hand, this could be shown to legislators, so they understand how detrimental it is for rural communities to not have internet access. Additionally, the target audience could be West Virginians living in counties with the highest percentages of internet access by household. These residents could be inspired by my presentation to make sure they elect politicians who prioritize broadband expansion. I think that residents of the counties with better internet access would be shocked to learn just how many of their neighboring counties do not have access. West Virginians are known for having a deep sense of loyalty and kindness towards one another, so I believe this presentation could evoke an emotional reaction from them. My presentation also speaks to people in metropolitan areas in neighboring states. By zooming in on Wetzel county, I am humanizing the data for Pittsburgh residents, since Wetzel County is only a two hour drive away.

## Interviewees
I decided to interview a West Virginia resident, a new Pittsburgh resident, and someone who has lived in Pittsburgh most of their life for my user research. I think these people were good choices because they represent different demographics from my target audience. I want to see if the presentation resonates with each of them. I am especially interested in hearing from the person who is new to Pittsburgh, to see if I can make them feel pulled to act on this cause since they do not have ties to the area. 

Interview 1: early 50s, long-time West Virginia resident
Interview 2: late 20s, long-time Pittsburgh resident
Interview 3: late 20s, recent Pittsburgh resident

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|What is the message of this presentation?|Access to broadband increases access to resources that can enhance a person's life educationally and professionally.|Internet access is important for economic growth & development (poverty reduction) and americans rely on internet for daily activities, but WV is disproportionately without internet access.| West Virginia has bad access to internet|
|Who do you believe is the target audience?|Government officials.|Policy-interested people especially in appalachia, anti-poverty advocates, consumers (internet users in and around WV/appalachia)|Policy Makers and West Virginians.|
|Was there anything that confused you?|The 1 in 5 stat was throwing me, I'm better with percentages.|Nope, it was very straightforward and easy to understand.|I thought it was random to bring up Wetzel County until I saw the rest of it. I was confused by why the comparison was to Allegheny all of a sudden. I would have thought a comparison to the county with the most broadband in the country or a county in WV with high broadband access would be the natural next step.|
|How did you feel after viewing these materials?|Frustrated and sad|Surprised that internet access was so low, grateful i have lived in places with good connectivity, and hopeful that things will change in terms of getting better broadband infrastructure to more rural and disconnected areas.|Disappointed that policy makers dont think its important to ensure broadband everywhere in the US.|
|Which visualization is the most impactful? Why?|The first map|The map showing internet access by county was useful, especially with the context of distance from major universities like proximity to WVU and Pittsburgh universities.|Less than 20% and more than 20% of households lacking internet access|
|Which visualization is the least impactful? Why?|All were impactful.|None.|I think the first visualization is the least impactful because it doesnt look like a huge gap comparing 27 to 40 -- I think the scale could convey the difference better.|
|Is there anything you would change?|The visualization titles could be clearer.|There's room to dig a bit deeper into why West Virginia has such low connectivity.|I would add some context for why Wetzel County is the one you are focusing on before you mention the "living in a different world" part. I would also add context on why the comparison is to Allegheny County|


# Identified changes for Part III

1. I want to make the first data visualization embedded instead of used as an image. I think it makes the shorthand more professional, intriguing, and interactive.
2. In all of my interviews, the participants believed there could be stronger titles for visualizations, so I want to work on making my titles shorter, but impactful.
3. I think it will be useful to add more context in the Wetzel County zoom in for people not familiar with the area. I will add more text to this section of my shorthand so the comparison is more clear.
4. I want to add some more strength to my data on the reasons behind West Virginia's low connectivity.
